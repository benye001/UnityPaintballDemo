# UnityPaintball

During the development of Six Seasons and a Game, there was a period of time where it looked like the Unreal Engine version of the project may never see the light of day. This is when I explored the possibility of porting the game to Unity, using the Mirror API for networking. I created this demo by myself using some existing art assets from the time, and retargeting animations from Mixamo.

Featuring:
- 8v8 multiplayer using Steam Matchmaking or LAN.
- Team Deathmatch.
- Character selection.
- Firearm selection, each one supporting its own set of first person / third person animations.
- Visible paintballs with bullet drop, authoritatively controlled by the host machine, but simulated on each client individually for instantaneous feedback.
- Designer-friendly controls for each firearms bullet profile, such as projectile speed, drop rate and damage.

Thanks for checking out my recent work! I’d love to get in touch.
